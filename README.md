# PINNs vs WENO: Comparative Study

This repository presents a comprehensive comparison between Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes for solving benchmark problems in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), such as the 2D lid-driven cavity (Navier-Stokes equations) and the Buckley-Leverett equation.

- **PINN:** A deep learning approach that incorporates physical laws into the loss function to learn solutions to partial differential equations.
- **WENO:** A high-order finite difference method widely used for solving hyperbolic PDEs with sharp gradients or discontinuities.

The scripts in this repository train PINN models and solve the same problems using WENO schemes, then quantitatively and visually compare their performance in terms of error metrics and computational residuals.

## Highlights

- Automated training and evaluation for both PINN and WENO on standard benchmarks.
- Detailed error and residual analysis with visualizations and summary files.
- Performance metrics and boundary condition error comparisons.
